This is the most useless cron job ever. It takes a start date, some gitlab repo credentials and a message. Your message is rasterized using [this awesome website's 3x5 font](http://www.network-science.de/ascii/) and based on the "color" of the current date the repo is either poked or not. Few months later the message shows up on the user's activity graph.
